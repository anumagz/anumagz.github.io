              Kamado as they seek for a cure to Nezuko's demon curse. Tanjiro and Nezuko become entangled in the affairs
              of a secret society, known as the Demon Slayer Corps, that have been waging a secret war against demons
              for centuries. The demons are former humans who sold their humanity in exchange for power, they feed on
              humans and possess super natural abilities such as super strength, magic and regeneration. Demons can only
              be killed if they're decapitated with weapons crafted from an alloy known as Sun Steel, injected with the
              poison of a flower called Wisteria, or exposed to sunlight. The Demon Slayers, on the other hand, are
              entirely human, however, they employ special breathing techniques, known as breaths, which grant them
              superhuman strength and increased resistance.</p>

              of four: it is estimated that around 80% of the world population has a Quirk. There are infinite types
              of Quirks, and it is extremely unlikely to find two people who have the exact same power, unless they
              are closely related. These particular abilities have allowed the development of a new category of
              people: Heroes, who face the evil-voted individuals who use the Quirks for selfish and criminal
              purposes, commonly known as Villains. In addition, Heroes who choose to exercise heroism at work level
              are recognized as Pro Heroes. Unless the individual is registered as a Pro Hero, the voluntary use of
              his or her Quirk in public places is considered a crime, except in exceptional cases</p>
